### Elevator pitch

Greyhound Writing is a platform designed for young writers to easily publish and get feedback to improve their writing to help them reach their maximum potential as authors. (Older authors can participate as well.) Few advertisements are used to make money, which is primarily given to the authors. It is sort of designed as a way for a school writing club to publish the short stories they write and make a little money off of it. It can also be used for journalism, nonfiction or stories, anything the writer wishes.

The authorUser uploads a story, which the Website saves to the Database. A readerUser accesses the website, first requesting a list of all stories from the database and then selecting a specific story to read. When the reader writes a comment on the story, the interaction uses a WebSocket connection to send the comment to the website in real-time. The Website saves the comment to the DB and retrieves updated comments with the same WebSocket channel, ensuring that the reader sees live updates.

### Key features

- Options for new users to view and read different stories published by other authors.
- Ways for users to comment and give public or private feedback to the authors.
- A messaging board
- A home page for authors with accounts where they can upload new stories and view feedback.

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - Design and layout the website, putting in the necessary boxes, text, and blueprints.
- **CSS** - Fill in the details and color of the website. 
- **React** - There will be an upload story, buttons for navigation, it would be nice to emplement a little filter for bad language in the reviews. 
- **Service** - Endpoints are as follows:
    - get stories
    - delete story, for the author only
    - add story
    - get comments (websocket)
    - add comments (websocket)
    - get users
    - add users
    - add conversation (websocket, if possible)
    - get conversation (websocket, if possible)
    - add message (websocket, if possible)
    - get messages (websocket, if possible)

- **DB/Login** - stores the authors/readers/users, their stories, each stories' reviews. Contains all authentication needed, such as only valid users can make, view, and review stories. 
- **WebSocket** - The comments/reviews will be the websocket. If we have extra time or that doesn't work then we can add messaging.
